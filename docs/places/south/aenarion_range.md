# Aenarion Range

Named for the Eladrin god that greated it, the Aenarion mountains make up the longest contiguous range in known Doloria.

The northern end is largely unexplored, with dense forests climbing the foothills and peaks, creating some of the most hostile terrain to anyone wishing to remain on the ground.

As one travels south the range becomes dotted sparsely with High-Elven academies and homesteads, connected with increasingly magically maintained pathways, winding through both pristine glades and sheer cliffs alike.

## The Kingspire / [elven name]

The tallest point in Doloria, is known as the Kingspire to most, but as [elven name] to the elves, as it symbolises [some symbolic thing]. Attempts to summit it's peak have been few and its actual measured height is as yet, unknown.
