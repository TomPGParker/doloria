# Reign of Dragons

When the gods created the world, they created the five dragon races to watch over the land. The dragons became greedy and covetous of their own lands and jealous of the the other dragons, over time making them more and more tyrannical. Revolts by the common folk were quickly quelled whenever they appeared as the dragons destroyed entire towns as their paranoia overwhelmed them. After the Birth of the Weave, the power of magic was quickly becoming something the dragons could no longer control. As more and more citizens took a stand against the dragons, the dragons remained stubborn and prideful. The Cabal od Dragons would not give up what they rightly believed was theirs and did not believe the disobedient lesser races deserved anything. Tensions rose and the common folk led by Dolor, Vitruvian and Caledor fought the dragons in what was later called the Draconic Fall
